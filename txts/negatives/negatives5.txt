Oh no, you kept putting off making your flood plan and then clean forgot!
You never bothered to learn what the flood warnings mean and now look where this has got you!
Rubbish - a special assembly to talk about flooding got cancelled because the teacher that was interested left the school. 
Your head teacher decides the school can’t afford to provide training for your teachers about how children are affected by flooding.
Oh no, nobody told you or your friends the support group was meeting so you missed it! 
Oh dear, your insurance company put everything back where it was cos that was the cheapest choice! 
Oh dear, you chose the builder who put everything back where it was cos their plan was the quickest.
